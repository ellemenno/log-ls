Custom formatters can be used by setting\nthe value of the `formatter` property to a `Formatter`-compliant class instance.\n\nA default printer is provided to log to `Console.print()`. Custom printers\ncan be used by setting the value of the `printer` property to a `Printer`-compliant\nclass instance.\n\nLogging functions expect a label to indicate the owner of the message, and\na function that should evaluate to a message when called. By capturing the\nmessage construction in a closure, any costs associated with forming the message\nare avoided for logging calls above the current verbosity threshold (log level).", name: "Log" }
